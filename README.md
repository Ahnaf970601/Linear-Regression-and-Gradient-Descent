# Linear-Regression-and-Gradient-Descent

1) Linear Regression:- Here I have demonstrated how linear regression is used to solve the problem statement which is as follows:- 


Suppose you are the CEO of a restaurant franchise and are considering different cities for opening a new outlet.

*You would like to expand your business to cities that may give your restaurant higher profits.

*The chain already has restaurants in various cities and you have data for profits and populations from the cities.
*You also have data on cities that are candidates for a new restaurant.
*For these cities, you have the city population.

 Can you use the data to help you identify which cities may potentially give your business higher profits?


Then I loaded the dataset in X-train and Y-Train, with X-train being the population of the city and y_train is the profit of a restaurant in that city. A negative value for profit indicates a loss. Both X_train and y_train are numpy arrays.

Then I coded a scatter plot to of the data to visualize and then finally wrote a code to find the cost function.


2) Gradient Descent:- Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm which is commonly-used to train machine learning models and neural networks. Training data helps these models learn over time, and the cost function within gradient descent specifically acts as a barometer, gauging its accuracy with each iteration of parameter updates. The pararmters were the same.
